						ask you for your email address, have you generate a password, agree to the
						terms and conditions, and click the sign-up button. ‍

						After the registration, you will be logged in and asked to install our Chrome
						extension. The extension makes all the functionalities possible, so it is
						required.
						<br />
						<br />
						We use your account information to:
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Create and maintain your user account, including in connection with
									other data points listed below.{' '}

								<p>
									Analyze the efficiency of our platform in our legitimate interests (GDPR
									Art. 6.1.f);

								<p>
									Upon receiving consent from you to send you marketing or promotional
									materials (GDPR Art. 6.1.a).
